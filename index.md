## About

As a **Software Developer**, I have less than a year of experience in the field. In my current role, I work primarily with **Node.js**, **Express** and **Typescript**. I am constantly looking for ways to improve my skills and expand my knowledge, which is why I am particularly interested in **DevOps**. I am currently in the process of training myself in this area, as I believe it will help me become a more well-rounded and valuable member of my team.

In my free time, I enjoy staying up to date with the latest trends and developments in the tech industry. I am also a **part-time technical blogger**, where I share my thoughts and insights on a variety of topics related to software development. You can find all my blogs [here](https://sayantansblog.hashnode.dev/)

Overall, I am passionate about technology and am excited to see where my career in the field will take me.
